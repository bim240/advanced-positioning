                    The Hewlett-Packard Company (commonly referred to as HP, and stylized as hp) or Hewlett-Packard (/ˈhjuːlɪt ˈpækərd/ HEW-lit PAK-ərd) was an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. In 1999, HP split into two companies: one retaining the original company name, the other named Agilent Technologies. The first product line of Hewlett-Packard, test and measurement equipment, went to Agilent Technologies, while HP retained focus on its later products including computers and printers. In 2015, HP again was split into two separate companies, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
